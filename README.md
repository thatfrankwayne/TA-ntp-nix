NTP Statistics Add-on for Splunk

Copyright &copy; 2016-2024 Frank Wayne

## Purpose

The NTP Statistics Add-on for Splunk allows a Splunk&trade; Enterprise administrator to index NTP v4 monitoring log data with proper timestamps, and perform detailed field extractions and calculations. If you have more than a casual interest in NTP, this Add-on will help you analyze NTP monitoring sets with greater ease than was ever before possible.

## Prerequisites and Dependencies

Detailed documentation, including installation, troubleshooting and release notes, is available online in [PDF format](https://github.com/thatfrankwayne/TA-ntp-nix/blob/main/docs/ntp_statistics_add-on_for_splunk_2.0.1.pdf).

### Forwarders

The NTP reference implementation (ntpd) must be installed and configured to generate logs.

### Indexers and Search Heads

The TA should be installed on indexers receiving events and on search heads for search-time parsing.

## Developer

The TA was developed by Frank Wayne.
